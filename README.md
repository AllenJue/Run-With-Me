# Run-With-Me

## Introduction
A simple running app, which utilizes Swift to create a user-friendly navigatable app to plan and track run stats.

## Technologies
* Swift (CoreLocation, SwiftUI)

## Features
Run With Me offers insights into a users movements when they are running, such as their average speed and distance traveled. Users can schedule runs, personalize the theme of their runs, as well as the features of the run (distance and time). This way, users can pace themselves, improve their running capabilities, all while gaining critical information to improve their performance.

Data in Run With Me is persistent, as user data is transactionally stored into the user's filesystem in their documents directory. This supports basic app features, such as saving data when inactive or closing the app. 

## TODO
* Add ability to remove runs
* Improve themes and UI decor
* Add more insights into runs
